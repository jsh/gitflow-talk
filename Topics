make a repo and look through it
add revisions and see what changes

make a clone and a bare clone, do a push and pull
put a repo on github
get the tool I built, and use it to create a repo

make branches and tags and show the branching structure with gitg/gitk
look at what those are, and remove them

gaze at all the git commands and git help
make a new git command

get git-flow and use it
